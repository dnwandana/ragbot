 * Express middleware that resolves an organization from the :org_id route parameter.

 * 1. Validates that org_id is a well-formed UUID
 * 2. Verifies the organization exists in the database
 * 3. Confirms the authenticated user is a member and loads their permissions
 *
 * On success, sets:
 * - `req.org` — `{ id, role_name }` of the resolved organization
 * - `req.permissions` — flat array of permission name strings for the user in this org
 *
 * @param {Object} req - Express request object (must have req.user.id from auth middleware)
 * @param {Object} res - Express response object
 * @param {Function} next - Express next middleware function
